<h1>Python Dialer</h1>

<p>This was a project of spite. Tired of relentless calls from a certain company (even though I am registered with the NDNCL, and requested they stop calling me multiple times over several years), I decided to fight back.</p>
<p>After confirming with the CRTC that there were no limitations on how many times I could call a private Canadian company, I went to work and unleashed this fun little program.</p>
<p>I may or may not have shut down the AVR system after bombarding them with a call every 5 seconds for 10 minutes, until their system flagged and blocked my outbound number. But its only $1 to buy a new number from Twilio.</p>
<p>I haven't used this since, but I keep it around for safe keepings.</p>
